## 🏢 Project Ownership Update

Effective **May 28th, 2025**, **ShadowCore is officially developed and maintained under [Shadow Development LLC](https://shadowdevelopment.net)**.  
This update reflects our transition from the informal "Shadow Development" name to a formally recognized legal entity.

> 🔐 This README was updated after the fact to reflect the official LLC formation date.  
> The transition does **not** affect licensing, project goals, or community involvement — only formal ownership.
